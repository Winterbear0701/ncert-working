## 📊 Database Architecture

### ChromaDB Structure:
```
chromadb_data/
└── ncert_books (collection)
    ├── Documents (text chunks)
    ├── Embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
    └── Metadata:
        ├── standard (5-10)
        ├── subject (Mathematics, Physics, etc.)
        ├── chapter (Chapter name)
        ├── page (Page number)
        ├── has_equations (boolean)
        ├── equation_count (integer)
        ├── content_type (math_heavy/text_heavy)
        ├── upload_id (reference)
        └── uploaded_at (timestamp)
```

### Enhanced Features:
- **Math-heavy subjects**: Detected automatically (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Science)
- **Equation tracking**: Counts symbols like =, +, -, ×, ÷, ∫, ∑, √, ∞
- **Smart retrieval**: Better context for math questions vs. text questions

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clean ChromaDB (Fresh Start)

```bash
# Run the cleanup script
python setup_chromadb.py
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Deletes old collection
- ✅ Creates fresh collection with proper metadata
- ✅ Verifies setup

### 2. Upload NCERT PDFs

**Steps:**
1. Login as superadmin: http://localhost:8000/accounts/login/
2. Go to: http://localhost:8000/superadmin/upload/
3. Upload PDF with metadata:
   - **Standard**: 5-10
   - **Subject**: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Science, etc.
   - **Chapter**: Chapter name
4. Click "Upload & Process"
5. Check status in dashboard

**Processing:**
- PDF is uploaded to `media/uploads/books/`
- Text extracted page by page
- Equations detected automatically
- Text chunked intelligently based on subject
- Embeddings generated with sentence-transformers
- Stored in ChromaDB with rich metadata

### 3. Manage ChromaDB

```bash
# Run the management tool
python manage_chromadb.py
```

**Features:**
1. **View Statistics**: See total docs, breakdown by standard/subject/chapter
2. **View Samples**: Inspect actual document content
3. **Search Content**: Test retrieval with queries
4. **Delete by Upload ID**: Remove specific uploads
5. **Clean Database**: Reset everything

---

## 📚 Recommended Upload Order

### For Best Results:

1. **Start with one subject per standard**:
   ```
   Standard 5 - Mathematics - Chapter 1
   Standard 5 - Mathematics - Chapter 2
   ...
   ```

2. **Then add other subjects**:
   ```
   Standard 5 - Science - Chapter 1
   Standard 5 - Science - Chapter 2
   ...
   ```

3. **Move to next standard**:
   ```
   Standard 6 - Mathematics - Chapter 1
   ...
   ```

### Why This Order?
- Easier to track progress
- Better organized in database
- Simpler to debug if issues arise
- Students can start using immediately

---

## 🧪 Testing the Pipeline

### 1. Test Upload:
```bash
# After uploading a PDF, check logs
tail -f logs/django.log
```

**Look for:**
- ✅ "Processing upload ID: X (SYNC)"
- ✅ "Extracted X pages with content"
- ✅ "Created X chunks from X pages (X chunks with equations)"
- ✅ "Successfully processed upload X: X chunks"

### 2. Test Database:
```bash
python manage_chromadb.py
# Choose option 1: View Statistics
```

**Expected Output:**
```
📊 ChromaDB Statistics
✅ Total documents: 150

📚 By Standard:
   Standard 5: 150 chunks

📖 By Subject:
   Mathematics: 150 chunks

📑 By Chapter:
   5-Mathematics-Chapter 1: 150 chunks
```

### 3. Test Chatbot:
1. Login as student
2. Go to chatbot
3. Ask: "Explain fractions from chapter 1"
4. Check if AI retrieves correct context

## 🎯 Enhanced Features Explanation

### 1. Subject-Aware Extraction

**Math/Science PDFs** (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry):
- Smaller chunk size (800 chars) to keep equations intact
- Detection of mathematical symbols
- Special handling for formulas
- Metadata tracks equation count

**Text PDFs** (History, Geography, etc.):
- Larger chunk size (1200 chars) for better context
- Focus on narrative flow
- Less overlap needed

### 2. Equation Detection

**Detected Symbols:**
- Basic: =, +, -, ×, ÷
- Advanced: ∫ (integral), ∑ (sum), √ (root)
- Comparison: ≤, ≥, <, >
- Special: π, ∞

**Metadata Stored:**
```python
{
    "has_equations": True,
    "equation_count": 15,
    "content_type": "math_heavy"
}
```

### 3. Smart Chunking

**Example for Mathematics PDF:**
```
Input: "The area of a circle is A = πr². Where r is radius..."

Chunk 1: "The area of a circle is A = πr². Where r is radius"
→ Keeps equation intact
→ equation_count: 2
→ has_equations: True
```

**Example for History PDF:**
```
Input: "The Mughal Empire was founded in 1526. Babur defeated..."

Chunk 1: "The Mughal Empire was founded in 1526. Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at..."
→ Larger context
→ has_equations: False
→ content_type: "text_heavy"
```

---

## 🔍 How Chatbot Uses the Enhanced Database

### Query: "What is the area formula for a circle?"

**Step 1**: Generate embedding for query

**Step 2**: Search ChromaDB with filters:
```python
where={
    "standard": "5",  # Student's standard
    "content_type": "math_heavy"  # Prefer math content
}
```

**Step 3**: Retrieve top 5 chunks with equations

**Step 4**: Format context:
```
[Std 5, Mathematics, Ch 1]
The area of a circle is A = πr². Where r is radius...

[Std 5, Mathematics, Ch 1]
To calculate area, square the radius and multiply by π...
```

**Step 5**: Send to AI with context

**Result**: Accurate, curriculum-aligned answer! ✅

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Current System:
- **Extraction**: ~2-5 seconds per page
- **Chunking**: ~1-2 seconds per page
- **Embedding**: ~0.1 seconds per chunk
- **ChromaDB Insert**: ~0.01 seconds per chunk

### Example: 50-page PDF
- Total time: ~5-10 minutes
- Chunks created: ~150-250
- Storage size: ~500KB in ChromaDB

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Upload fails
**Solution:**
1. Check `logs/django.log`
2. Verify media directory exists: `media/uploads/books/`
3. Check file is valid PDF
4. Ensure enough disk space

### Issue: No results in chatbot
**Solution:**
1. Run `python manage_chromadb.py`
2. Check if PDFs are uploaded
3. Verify student's standard matches uploaded content
4. Check ChromaDB has documents

### Issue: Equations not detected
**Solution:**
1. PDFs with scanned images won't work (OCR needed)
2. Check if PDF has selectable text
3. For complex equations, consider Nougat OCR (advanced)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### 1. **Nougat OCR Integration**
For scanned PDFs with complex equations:
```python
# Install Nougat
pip install nougat-ocr

# Use in tasks.py
from nougat import NougatModel
model = NougatModel.from_pretrained("facebook/nougat-base")
```

### 2. **Web Scraping**
For real-time data:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def search_web(query):
    # Scrape educational sites
    # Add to context
    pass
```

### 3. **Image Recognition**
For diagrams and figures:
```python
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

def extract_images(pdf_path):
    # Extract images
    # OCR text from images
    # Add to chunks
    pass
```
