## üìä How Evaluation Works

### For 1-Mark Questions (Short Answer)

**Evaluation Method**: Case-insensitive exact match

**Example:**
```
Model Answer: "Photosynthesis"
Student Answers That Get Full Marks:
‚úì "photosynthesis"
‚úì "PHOTOSYNTHESIS"
‚úì "Photosynthesis."
‚úì "  photosynthesis  "

Student Answers That Get Zero:
‚úó "Photo synthesis" (extra space)
‚úó "process of photosynthesis" (extra words)
```

**Why This Approach?**
- Fair: Students shouldn't lose marks for capitalization or punctuation in short answers
- Clear: Either correct or incorrect, no ambiguity
- Fast: Instant evaluation without AI overhead

---

### For 2-5 Mark Questions (Long Answer)

**Evaluation Method**: AI-powered content and grammar analysis

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Total Marks = (Content Score √ó 0.7 + Grammar Score √ó 0.3) √ó Question Marks
```

#### Content Evaluation (70%)

The AI compares the student's answer with the **model answer provided by staff** and checks:
- ‚úÖ All key concepts covered
- ‚úÖ Factual accuracy
- ‚úÖ Depth and completeness
- ‚úÖ Understanding demonstrated

**Scoring Guide:**
- **90-100%**: Excellent - All key points covered accurately
- **70-89%**: Good - Most key points covered
- **50-69%**: Average - Some key points missing
- **30-49%**: Below Average - Significant gaps
- **0-29%**: Poor - Major concepts missing

#### Grammar Evaluation (30%)

The AI assesses language quality:
- ‚úÖ Sentence structure
- ‚úÖ Grammar correctness
- ‚úÖ Punctuation and capitalization
- ‚úÖ Spelling accuracy
- ‚úÖ Clarity and coherence

**Scoring Guide:**
- **90-100%**: Excellent - Perfect or near-perfect
- **70-89%**: Good - Minor errors
- **50-69%**: Average - Several errors but understandable
- **30-49%**: Below Average - Frequent errors
- **0-29%**: Poor - Major grammar issues

## üéì Example Evaluation

### Question (5 marks)
**"Explain the process of photosynthesis."**

### Model Answer (Provided by Staff)
```
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants make their own food using 
sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. Chlorophyll in the leaves absorbs sunlight. 
The plant takes in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. Using 
the energy from sunlight, these are converted into glucose (food) and oxygen. 
The oxygen is released into the air.
```

### Student Answer 1 (High Score)
```
Photosynthesis is the process where green plants produce food. Plants use 
sunlight, carbon dioxide from air, and water from soil. Chlorophyll in leaves 
captures sunlight energy. This energy converts CO2 and water into glucose 
which is food for the plant. Oxygen is produced and released as a byproduct.
```

**AI Evaluation:**
- Content Score: 95% (All key concepts covered, excellent understanding)
- Grammar Score: 90% (Well-written, minor room for improvement)
- **Total: 4.58/5 marks**

**Feedback:**
```
üìä Score Breakdown:
‚Ä¢ Content: 3.32/3.5 marks (95%)
‚Ä¢ Grammar & Expression: 1.35/1.5 marks (90%)
‚Ä¢ Total: 4.58/5 marks

Excellent answer! You've covered all the key concepts of photosynthesis clearly. 
Your explanation of the inputs (sunlight, CO2, water) and outputs (glucose, oxygen) 
is accurate. The role of chlorophyll is correctly mentioned. Your sentences are 
clear and well-structured.

Minor suggestion: You could mention that chlorophyll is specifically what makes 
leaves green to add more detail.
```

### Student Answer 2 (Medium Score)
```
photosynthesis is when plants make food they use sun and water and co2 to 
make food and give oxygen
```

**AI Evaluation:**
- Content Score: 60% (Basic concepts covered but lacks detail)
- Grammar Score: 40% (Poor sentence structure, capitalization issues)
- **Total: 2.7/5 marks**

**Feedback:**
```
üìä Score Breakdown:
‚Ä¢ Content: 2.1/3.5 marks (60%)
‚Ä¢ Grammar & Expression: 0.6/1.5 marks (40%)
‚Ä¢ Total: 2.7/5 marks

You have the basic idea of photosynthesis, which is good! However, your answer 
needs more detail. Missing key points:
- Role of chlorophyll in capturing sunlight
- Where water comes from (soil/roots)
- The specific product name (glucose, not just "food")

Grammar improvements needed:
- Start sentences with capital letters
- Use proper punctuation (periods, commas)
- Write in complete sentences instead of run-on sentences
- Example: "Photosynthesis is the process where plants make food. They use..."
```

## üîß How Staff Creates Questions

When creating a unit test, staff provides:

1. **Question Text**: The actual question
2. **Model Answer**: The expected correct answer (this is crucial!)
3. **Marks**: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5

**Example Setup:**
```
Question Number: 1
Marks: 1
Question: "What is the powerhouse of the cell?"
Model Answer: "Mitochondria"

Question Number: 2
Marks: 3
Question: "Explain the function of mitochondria in a cell."
Model Answer: "Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell. They 
produce energy in the form of ATP through cellular respiration. They break 
down glucose and oxygen to release energy that the cell needs for various 
functions."
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Choosing AI Model

You can set the default AI model in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Use Gemini (default, recommended)
DEFAULT_EVAL_AI=gemini

# Or use OpenAI
DEFAULT_EVAL_AI=openai
```

### API Keys Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env`:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Note**: The system will automatically fallback if one model fails:
- If Gemini fails ‚Üí tries OpenAI
- If OpenAI fails ‚Üí tries Gemini
- If both fail ‚Üí uses heuristic scoring

### For Administrators
1. **Monitor API usage**: Check API quotas for Gemini/OpenAI
2. **Review evaluations**: Periodically check if AI is grading fairly
3. **Adjust weights**: If needed, modify content/grammar ratio
4. **Keep model answers updated**: Ensure they match current curriculum

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: All answers getting 0 marks
**Solution**: Check if model answers are properly saved in the database

### Issue: Evaluation fails
**Solution**: 
1. Verify API keys in `.env`
2. Check API quota/limits
3. Review logs for specific error messages

### Issue: Inconsistent grading
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure model answers are detailed and clear
2. Try switching AI models
3. Check if caching is causing issues (clear cache)

### Issue: Grammar scores too harsh
**Solution**: The 30% weight ensures grammar doesn't dominate. This is balanced for Indian school standards.
