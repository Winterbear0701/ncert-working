The sun heats water in oceans, rivers, and lakes, causing evaporation where water 
turns into water vapor. This vapor rises and cools in the atmosphere, undergoing 
condensation to form clouds. When clouds become heavy, water falls back to Earth 
as precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or hail). The water then collects in water 
bodies or seeps into the ground, and the cycle continues.

The water cycle is important because it provides fresh water for drinking, 
agriculture, and industry. It helps regulate Earth's temperature and distributes 
water resources across different regions. It also supports all forms of life on Earth."""
