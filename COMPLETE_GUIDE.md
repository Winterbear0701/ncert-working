## 📊 Enhanced Features Details

### Subject-Aware Processing

**Math/Science PDFs** (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Science):
- ✅ Smaller chunks (800 chars) to preserve equations
- ✅ Equation detection and counting
- ✅ Special metadata: `content_type: "math_heavy"`
- ✅ Better retrieval for mathematical queries

**Text PDFs** (History, Geography, English, etc.):
- ✅ Larger chunks (1200 chars) for better context
- ✅ Focus on narrative flow
- ✅ Metadata: `content_type: "text_heavy"`
- ✅ Better retrieval for conceptual questions

### Equation Detection

**Detected Symbols**:
- Basic operators: `=`, `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`
- Advanced: `∫` (integral), `∑` (summation), `√` (root)
- Comparison: `≤`, `≥`
- Special: `π`, `∞`

**Metadata Stored**:
```json
{
    "has_equations": true,
    "equation_count": 15,
    "content_type": "math_heavy"
}
```

### Smart Retrieval

**Chatbot Query**: "What is the area formula for a circle?"

**ChromaDB Search**:
1. Generate embedding for query
2. Filter by student's standard
3. Prefer chunks with `has_equations: true`
4. Retrieve top 5 most relevant chunks
5. Format context with metadata
6. Send to AI (Gemini/OpenAI)

**Result**: Accurate, equation-aware answer! ✅

## 🔧 Technical Details

### PDF Processing Pipeline:

```
1. Upload PDF
   ↓
2. Detect subject type (math_heavy vs text_heavy)
   ↓
3. Extract text page-by-page with pdfplumber
   ↓
4. Detect equations on each page
   ↓
5. Apply smart chunking (size based on subject)
   ↓
6. Generate embeddings with sentence-transformers
   ↓
7. Store in ChromaDB with rich metadata
   ↓
8. Update status to 'done'
```

### ChromaDB Schema:

```python
{
    "id": "upload_1_page_5_chunk_2",
    "text": "The area of a circle is A = πr²...",
    "embedding": [0.123, 0.456, ...],  # 384 dimensions
    "metadata": {
        "standard": "5",
        "subject": "Mathematics",
        "chapter": "Geometry",
        "page": 5,
        "chunk_index": 2,
        "has_equations": True,
        "equation_count": 3,
        "content_type": "math_heavy",
        "source_file": "math_class5.pdf",
        "upload_id": "1",
        "uploaded_at": "2025-10-07T10:30:00"
    }
}
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Upload fails
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f logs/django.log

# Verify media directory
ls media/uploads/books/

# Check file permissions
```

### Issue 2: No equations detected
**Reason**: PDF might be scanned image (not selectable text)
**Solution**: 
- Ensure PDF has selectable text
- For scanned PDFs, consider Nougat OCR (advanced feature)

### Issue 3: Chatbot returns no context
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check database
python manage_chromadb.py
# Option 1: View Statistics

# Ensure student's standard matches uploaded content
# Example: Student is Std 5, upload Std 5 PDFs
```

### Issue 4: Slow processing
**Reason**: Large PDFs or many pages
**Solution**:
- Normal for 100+ page PDFs
- Processing happens once, retrieval is fast
- Consider splitting into chapters

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### 1. Nougat OCR for Scanned PDFs
```bash
pip install nougat-ocr
```
- Handles scanned math textbooks
- Extracts equations from images
- Better accuracy for complex formulas

### 2. Web Scraping for Real-Time Data
```python
def search_web(query):
    # Scrape Wikipedia, Khan Academy, etc.
    # Add to chatbot context
    # Provide up-to-date information
```

### 3. Image Extraction & OCR
```python
def extract_diagrams(pdf_path):
    # Extract figures and diagrams
    # OCR text from images
    # Store separately in database
```

### 4. Celery for Async Processing
```bash
# Install Redis
# Install Celery
celery -A ncert_project worker --loglevel=info

# Uncomment Celery code in views.py
# Use process_uploaded_book.delay() for background tasks
```
